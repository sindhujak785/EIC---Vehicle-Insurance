#  EIC Vehicle Insurance ‚Äì Power BI Dashboard

This project presents an **interactive Power BI dashboard** analyzing vehicle insurance data for a fictional company named **EIC**. The goal is to understand customer behavior, policy performance, claim trends, and key insurance KPIs.

Inspired by a tutorial from the [Chandoo YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TazNFzgWtgA), this project helped me practice DAX, data modeling, and storytelling using visuals.
